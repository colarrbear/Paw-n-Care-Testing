## Installation the Application
Read and follow the instructions in [Installation the Application](Installation.md).

## Running the Application
1. Start the server in the virtual environment. <br>
  Activate the virtualenv for this project
   * On Windows:
   ``` 
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   * On macOS and Linux:
   ``` 
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Start the django server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   This starts a web server listening on port 8000.

2. You should see this message printed in the terminal window:
   ```
   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

   If you get a message that the port is unavailable, then run the server on a different port (1024 thru 65535) such as:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver 12345
   ```

2. In a web browser, navigate to <http://localhost:8000>

3. To stop the server, press CTRL-C in the terminal window. Exit the virtual environment by closing the window or by typing:
